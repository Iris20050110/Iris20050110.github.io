                <p>
                A moon in the well, <br>
                Full and bright, reflects the sky.  <br>
                I see it in me.</p>

                <p>
                I know the world well <br>
                Like I see me through mirrors –  <br>
                Fragile yet lasting.

                <h2 id="A Poem for Misery"><br> A Poem for Misery</h2>
                <p>I wrote a poem for misery  <br>
                Sung by the stars, but nobody heard   <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.   <br>
                                                  <br>
                Rivers were on fire and prairies were blown away.      <br>
                The earth silenced and couldn’t say a word.    <br>
                I wrote a poem for misery.            <br>
                                                     <br>
                The sky above heads was dull and gray.   <br>
                But the olive branch was carried by birds    <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.      <br>
                                                    <br>
                The gilded Buddha is wooden they say  <br>
                Yet as soft as winds chasing the herd.  <br>
                I wrote a poem for misery.      <br>
                                                <br>
                I once wished for a sunny day.   <br>
                But why were my eyes in tears blurred——       <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.          <br>
                                                     <br>
                The pain in stories never passed away.   <br>
                While memories faded, I look backward.   <br>
                I wrote a poem for misery         <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.    <br>
