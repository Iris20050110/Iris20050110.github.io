                <h2 id='A Well'>A Well</h2>
                <p>
                A moon in the well, <br>
                Full and bright, reflects the sky.  <br>
                I see it in me.</p>

                <h2 id='World'><br>World</h2>
                <p>
                I know the world well <br>
                Like I see me through mirrors –  <br>
                Fragile yet lasting.  </p>

                <h2 id="A Poem for Misery"><br> A Poem for Misery</h2>
                <p>I wrote a poem for misery  <br>
                Sung by the stars, but nobody heard   <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.   <br>
                                                  <br>
                Rivers were on fire and prairies were blown away.      <br>
                The earth silenced and couldn’t say a word.    <br>
                I wrote a poem for misery.            <br>
                                                     <br>
                The sky above heads was dull and gray.   <br>
                But the olive branch was carried by birds    <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.      <br>
                                                    <br>
                The gilded Buddha is wooden they say  <br>
                Yet as soft as winds chasing the herd.  <br>
                I wrote a poem for misery.      <br>
                                                <br>
                I once wished for a sunny day.   <br>
                But why were my eyes in tears blurred——       <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.          <br>
                                                     <br>
                The pain in stories never passed away.   <br>
                While memories faded, I look backward.   <br>
                I wrote a poem for misery         <br>
                To praise the forgotten story.    <br>

                <h2 id='Purple Sky'><br>Purple Sky</h2>
                <p>
                It’s a purple day   <br>
                Shine on the speeding highway.      <br>
                Send the glare away            <br>
                Sleep under the moonlight of May. <br> <br>

                It’s a purple day         <br>
                Blues, beer cans, and a romance story.    <br>
                Soap opera and drowsiness make somebody stay  <br>
                Dream about a dream with an X lover on the bay     <br> <br>

                It’s a purple day   <br>
                Dark night, white dreams, and countless past stories.   <br>
                No, maybe I shouldn’t call it a purple day.        <br>
                On a starless way. </p>

                <h2 id='The Sky Is a Big Hole'><br>The Sky Is a Big Hole</h2>
                <p>
                The sky has a big hole poked by a bird,   <br>
                Huffing and puffing in the wet wind.    <br>
                The green carriage lurches over the hill.    <br>
                In the moment of weightlessness, I jump into the world.     <br><br>

                The mountain has a big hole poked by a horse,   <br>
                Racing and tearing through the stifling fog.   <br>
                Carnival drums and balloons ignore me.    <br>
                In the moment of disappearance, I sleep in the hills.   <br><br>

                Summer has a big hole poked by the rain,     <br>
                Absorbing and sucking the green of the universe.  <br>
                Drops of water join to form rivers.   <br>
                In the moment the drops fall, I escape from the world.  <br><br>

                The world has become a big hole,       <br>
                Stuffed with bright red and oily green ink. <br>
                The meandering streams lagging and dragging their tails.    <br>
                In the moment of drying, I break the flow.
