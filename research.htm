        <h1 id='Music Emotion'>"A Novel Music Recommendation System using Music-Emotion Recognition Models"</h1>
        <p>In this study, I compare a emotion-based music recommendation system with a traditional style-and-
        artists-based music recommendation system adapted by most music streaming services nowadays. To quantize emotion as a measurable variable, 
          I use the classic Russell's emotion ring that
        classifies 4 basic types of emotions--excitement, calm, depression, and anger--into a quadrant. After trainings 3 different machine learning models,
        the music-emotion recognizer is able to reach almost 80% accuracy F1 score. It demonstrates especial
        capability in predicting emotions excitement and anger.</p>

         <h1 id="Responsibility Aversion"><br>"An Analysis on the Relationship between
         Leadership and Responsibility Aversion"</h1>
         <p>As leadership increasingly becomes critical for society today, we grow interest in the
         responsibility and possible responsibility aversion brought by leadership. We define
         responsibility aversion as the preference to minimize one's causal role in outcome
         generation. We hypothesize a causal relationship exists between leadership and
         responsibility aversion. The level of aversion is dependent on both the responsibilities
         of leaders and the common traits of leadership positions.<br>
         Through a survey towards high school and college students, we found that responsibility
         delegation is a common approach for leaders to avoid their taking account of their own
         responsibilities. People who had leadership experience before tend to be more courageous
         in taking leadersâ€™ roles. Furthermore, leaders who understand that their decisions and
         attitudes would affect group morale and efficiency are more responsible for their groups. </p>
