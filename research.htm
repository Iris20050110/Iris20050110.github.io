        <h1 id='Music Emotion'>"A Novel Music Recommendation System using Music-Emotion Recognition Models"</h1>
        <p>I delved into the study of music and emotion because of my years of interest in violin. When I play the violin, I focus on learning how to create different emotions in the music by playing with different volumes, strengths, tempos, etc. The experience of playing the violin inspired me to discover the relationship between musical emotions and fundamental musical elements. Using three AI models, I attempted to predict four types of emotions based on more than a hundred types of musical features.</p>
        
      
         <h1 id="Responsibility Aversion"><br>"An Analysis on the Relationship between
         Leadership and Responsibility Aversion"</h1>
         <p>Throughout my years in high school, I found my friends and I were often in positions of leadership to lead and advance an organization or community. However, leadership often comes with greater responsibility and social pressure. Recognizing the significance of leadership, my groupmate and I in the Future Science Scholar Organization (FuSSO) decided to take a different perspective to study the possibility of responsibility aversion brought on by the pressures of leadership. Through an online survey, we collected and analyzed 160 high school and college students' perceptions of leadership and responsibility.</p>
